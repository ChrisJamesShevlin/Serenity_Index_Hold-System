The Serenity Ratio is a risk-adjusted performance metric used in finance and investment management. It is designed to evaluate the return of an investment relative to its risk, similar to other metrics like the Sharpe Ratio or Sortino Ratio. However, the Serenity Ratio places particular emphasis on downside risk and provides a more conservative measure of performance by focusing on negative volatility (i.e., losses or drawdowns).

The formula for the Serenity Ratio is:

Serenity Ratio
=
Annualized Return
Maximum Drawdown
×
Standard Deviation of Negative Returns
Serenity Ratio= 
Maximum Drawdown×Standard Deviation of Negative Returns
Annualized Return
​
 
Annualized Return: The compounded return of an investment over a year.
Maximum Drawdown (MDD): The largest observed loss from a peak to a trough of an investment's value.
Standard Deviation of Negative Returns: A measure of how much the negative returns deviate from their average (essentially focusing only on the downside risk).
Interpretation:
A higher Serenity Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance, particularly in terms of handling downside risk and drawdowns.
A low Serenity Ratio suggests that the investment has either a high maximum drawdown or significant downside volatility, making it riskier relative to its returns.
The Serenity Ratio is particularly useful for investors who prioritize capital preservation and are more concerned with minimizing losses rather than maximizing gains.
